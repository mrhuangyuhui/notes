```ruby
formatter = "%{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth}"

puts formatter % {first: 1, second: 2, third: 3, fourth: 4}
puts formatter % {first: "one", second: "two", third: "three", fourth: "four"}

puts formatter % {first: true, second: false, third: true, fourth: false}
puts formatter % {first: formatter, second: formatter, third: formatter, fourth: formatter}

puts formatter % {
    first: "I had this thing.",
    second: "That you could type up right.",
    third: "But it didn't sing.",
    fourth: "So I said goodnight."
}
```

输出结果：
```
1 2 3 4
one two three four
true false true false
%{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth} %{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth} %{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth} %{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth}
I had this thing. That you could type up right. But it didn't sing. So I said goodnight.
```

**格式化字符串，用 `%{}` 和 `#{}` 都可以，当需要给多个值指定同一格式，用 `%{}` 更好用。**
