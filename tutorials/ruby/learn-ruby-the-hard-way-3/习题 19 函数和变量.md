# 习题 19 函数和变量

```
# ex19.rb

def cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers)
    puts "You have #{cheese_count} cheeses!"
    puts "You have #{boxes_of_crackers} boxes of crackers!"
    puts "Man that's enough for a party!"
    puts "Get a blanket.\n"
end

puts "We can just give the function numbers directly!"
cheese_and_crackers(20, 30)

puts "OR, we can use variable from our script:"
amount_of_cheese = 10
amount_of_crackers = 50

cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese, amount_of_crackers)

puts "We can even do math inside too:"
cheese_and_crackers(10 + 20, 5 + 6)

puts "And we can combine the two, variables and math:"
cheese_and_crackers(amount_of_cheese + 100, amount_of_crackers + 1000)
```

结果：
```bash
$ ruby ex19.rb
We can just give the function numbers directly!
You have 20 cheeses!
You have 30 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.
OR, we can use variable from our script:
You have 10 cheeses!
You have 50 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.
We can even do math inside too:
You have 30 cheeses!
You have 11 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.
And we can combine the two, variables and math:
You have 110 cheeses!
You have 1050 boxes of crackers!
Man that's enough for a party!
Get a blanket.
