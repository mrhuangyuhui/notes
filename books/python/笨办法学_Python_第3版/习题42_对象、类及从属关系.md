# 习题 42 对象、类及从属关系

```py
class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

class Cat(Animal):
    pass

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.pet = None

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        super(Employee, self).__init__(name)
        self.salary = salary

satan = Cat('Satan')
mary = Person('Mary')
mary.pet = satan
print "%s has a cat named %s." % (mary.name, mary.pet.name)

rover = Dog('Rover')
frank = Employee('Frank', 120000)
frank.pet = rover
print "%s's salary is %d. He has a dog named %s." % (frank.name, frank.salary, frank.pet.name)
```

输出结果

```bash
$ python2 example.py
Mary has a cat named Satan.
Frank's salary is 120000. He has a dog named Rover.
```

调用父类的初始化方法

```py
super(Employee, self).__init__(name)
```
