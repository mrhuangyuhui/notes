# Tuples

[The Basics - Tuples](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID329)

The values within a tuple can be of any type and donâ€™t have to be of the same type as each other.

```swift
let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")

let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(statusCode)")
print("The status message is \(statusMessage)")

let (justTheStatusCode, _) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(justTheStatusCode)")

print("The status code is \(http404Error.0)")
print("The status message is \(http404Error.1)")
```

You can name the individual elements in a tuple when the tuple is defined:

```swift
let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")
print("The status code is \(http200Status.statusCode)")
print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")
```
